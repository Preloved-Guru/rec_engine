# PreLoved Guru Recommendation Engine

This project extends [Gorse](https://github.com/gorse-io/gorse) - an open-source recommendation system engine - to create a specialized recommendation system for secondhand fashion marketplaces. Our implementation adds visual similarity matching and automated recommendation strategy optimization through multi-armed bandits.

## Project Overview

PreLoved Guru's recommendation engine combines multiple recommendation strategies to provide personalized suggestions for secondhand fashion items:

1. **Collaborative Filtering** (via Gorse)
   - User-based recommendations
   - Item-based recommendations
   - Matrix factorization

2. **Visual Similarity** (Our Extension)
   - Image embedding-based similarity matching
   - Category-aware recommendations
   - Visual style matching

3. **Automated Strategy Optimization** (Our Extension)
   - Multi-armed bandit system for dynamic strategy selection
   - Automated learning of user preferences between CF and visual recommendations
   - Real-time adaptation to user behavior

## Architecture

The system is built as an extension to Gorse's monorepo architecture, adding new components while maintaining compatibility with Gorse's core functionality:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ storage/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ embeddings/           # Image embedding storage implementation

```

## Setup and Testing

### Prerequisites
- Linux/WSL2
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Go 1.20+
- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)

### Quick Start
We provide a set of scripts to make setup and running the system easy:

```bash
# 1. Make scripts executable
cd misc/build_scripts
chmod +x *.sh

# 2. Install all dependencies and build components
./install.sh

# 3. Start all services (including database population)
./build.sh

# 4. To stop all services
./stop.sh
```

The build script will start:
1. PostgreSQL database (Docker)
2. Redis cache (Docker)
3. Gorse recommendation engine
4. PreLoved Guru web application
5. Automatically populate the database with synthetic data

You can then access:
- Web Application: http://localhost:3000
- Gorse API: http://localhost:8087

### Logs
All component logs are available in the `logs` directory:
- `gorse-server.log`: Logs from the Gorse recommendation engine server
- `gorse-worker.log`: Logs from the Gorse recommendation engine worker
- `webapp.log`: Logs from the Next.js web application

### Manual Testing
If you want to run individual components or tests:

```bash
# Run Go tests
go test ./...

# Generate synthetic data manually
cd misc/data_generation
./populate_db.sh
```

### Environment Management
The system uses a Conda environment named `preloved_guru` for Python dependencies. This is handled automatically by the build scripts, but if needed:

```bash
# Activate environment manually
conda activate preloved_guru

# Deactivate environment when done
conda deactivate
```
